# Brain-tumour-detection
This is an AI ML project which detects the type of brain tumour from the given MRI Image as input.
The data set is taken from kaggle.
This model uses one hot encoding and efficientNet B0 as the CNN model which is used for training the model.
Transfer Learning is done to get the best accuracy for the model we create
